# Running hREA Backend

Before trying to develop a user interface or service on top of hREA, you need to be running the hREA backend, within a holochain runtime.



Download the `hrea_suite.happ` file from [this hREA release](https://github.com/h-REA/hREA/releases/tag/happ-0.1.2-beta).



You need to install some packages to your command line, which you can do manually, or via the nix-shell dev environment manager. There are instructions for either way that you choose right below this, just click to expand the section you would like to follow.

Needs updating... coming soon.

<summary>Without Nix-shell</summary>

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), if you don't have it installed already.

Install the following to your system, via Rusts package manager "cargo".



The following installs a holochain developer tools binary to your system, accessible as the binary `hc` on your system.

```
cargo install holochain_cli --version 0.1.3 --locked
```



The following installs the core holochain runtime to your system, accessible as the binary `holochain` on your system. It can be used directly, or implicitly via the `hc sandbox` calls that we make next.

```
cargo install holochain --version 0.1.3 --locked
```



The following is the secure private key enclave that `holochain` uses for cryptography. It is available as a binary on your path `lair-keystore`, but `holochain` manages these subprocesses automatically on your behalf.

```bash
cargo install lair_keystore --version 0.2.3 --locked
```



</details>



Set up a holochain development "sandbox". A temporary directory on your file system that will store all your keys and data for the hREA happ that you are about to install and run. `network quic` is there to instruct `holochain` to use a specific kind of networking, known as `quic`.

```
echo \"pass\" | hc sandbox --piped create -n 1 -d hrea_tester network quic
```



Install the hREA hApp to your holochain sandbox. Make sure you use the right path to wherever on your filesystem you have `hrea_suite.happ` file that you downloaded.

```
echo \"pass\" | hc sandbox --piped call install-app ./hrea_suite.happ
```



Start your holochain "sandbox" runtime, attaching ports for admin level websocket server on port 4001 and for an app level websocket server on port 4000.&#x20;

```
echo \"pass\" | hc sandbox --piped -f=4001 run --all --ports 4000
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can safely stop and restart this particular process, and don't have to rerun the other steps. This is the process that you must have running in order to develop a user interface or service with an hREA backend.&#x20;
