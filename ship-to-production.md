# Ship To Production

An easy method by which you can release Holochain apps at the moment is via [Kangaroo](https://github.com/holochain-apps/kangaroo-tauri). This allows you to package your hApps for installation on Windows, Mac and Linux machines. Users can download your hREA app alongside Holochain, and run a private network.&#x20;

Another option is to release your app in the [Holochain Launcher](https://github.com/holochain/launcher#packaging-a-web-happ).
